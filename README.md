📌 Recipe-App — Project Description

Recipe-App is a web application built with React.js that allows users to search, browse, and view food recipes, including ingredient lists and images.

🔍 Recipe Search: Users can type keywords to search for recipes.

📋 Recipe Listings: Shows a list of recipe cards with images and titles.

🍽 Recipe Details: Clicking a recipe shows more information, including ingredients and instructions.

⭐ Favorites: Users can save recipes to their favorites list using localStorage so favorites persist across sessions.
